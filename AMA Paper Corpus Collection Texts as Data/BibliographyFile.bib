	abstract = {Research evidence shows that perceived injustice is a context-based unfair treatment that has negative influence on health outcomes. We examined the contribution of patients' perceived injustice regarding interactions with health care providers to stress and pain in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study was a cross-sectional correlational pilot study. Included in the study were adults with SCD who received their care from a university-affiliated comprehensive sickle cell clinic. Participants were 52 adults whose mean age was 34 ± 11 years (minimum [min] 20 years, maximum [max] 70 years). Most of the patients were African American (n = 48, 92\%) and female (n = 41, 79\%). Forty-eight patients (92\%) reported having a high school diploma or higher. Participants completed the perceived injustice questionnaire, perceived stress questionnaire, and the PAINReportIt, which includes questions to measure pain and demographics. We analyzed the data using the linear regression analyses. Perceived injustice from doctors was a significant predictor of perceived stress (p {\textless} .001) and pain (p = .002). Perceived injustice from nurses also was a significant predictor of perceived stress (p {\textless} .001) and pain (p = .02). The procedural, distributive, and informational domains of perceived injustice attributed to both doctors and nurses consistently predicted patients' perceived stress, but only the procedural and distributive domains of perceived injustice consistently predicted patients' pain. Findings suggest that perceived injustice was negatively associated with stress and pain in adults with SCD and warrant further investigation in a larger sample.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) report experiencing discriminatory behavior from some healthcare providers. The impact of discrimination on health outcomes in SCD, including adherence to physician recommendations, is not known.

OBJECTIVE
Our aim was to evaluate the association between perceived discrimination from healthcare providers and nonadherence to physician recommendations among persons with SCD, and to test the potentially mediating role of patient trust.

PARTICIPANTS
Patients with SCD (age 15 years and older) participating in the Improving Patient Outcomes with Respect and Trust (IMPORT) Study.

MAIN MEASURES
Perceived discrimination from healthcare providers and reported adherence to physician recommendations were assessed by patient self-report using items from the 2001 Commonwealth Fund Health Survey. Interpersonal trust in medical professionals was assessed using the short form of the Wake Forest Trust in Medical Professionals instrument.

DESIGN
We used a cross-sectional analysis of IMPORT participant data. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to test the independent association of discrimination with adherence and to test patient trust as a potential mediator.

KEY RESULTS
Among 273 SCD patients with complete data on all variables of interest, patients reporting experiences of discrimination in the healthcare system were 53 \% more likely to also report being nonadherent to physician recommendations. Trust in medical professionals appeared to mediate the discrimination/nonadherence relationship, accounting for 50 \% of the excess prevalence of nonadherence among those experiencing discrimination.

CONCLUSION
SCD patient perceptions of discriminatory experiences from healthcare providers are associated with greater nonadherence to physician recommendations, and may be a potential factor contributing to disparities in health and health quality among this patient population. Perceived discrimination appears to affect adherence behaviors through the pathway of patient trust. Improving relationships between healthcare providers and SCD patients may improve the trust that SCD patients have in medical professionals, which in turn may improve other outcomes among this underserved patient population.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience longer wait times to see a physician after arrival to an emergency department (ED) compared to patients with long bone fracture and patients presenting with all other possible conditions (General Patient Sample), and to attempt to disentangle the effects of race and disease status on any observed differences.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, comparative analysis of year 2003 through 2008 data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative sample of nonfederal emergency department visits in the United States. Our primary outcome was wait time (in minutes) to see a physician after arrival to an ED. A generalized linear model was used to examine ratios of wait times comparing SCD visits to the two comparison groups.
RESULTS: SCD patients experienced wait times 25\% longer than the General Patient Sample, though this difference was explained by the African-American race of the SCD patients. SCD patients waited 50\% longer than did patients with long bone fracture even after accounting for race and assigned triage priority.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCD presenting to an ED for care experience longer wait times than other groups, even after accounting for assigned triage level. The African-American race of the SCD patients, and their status as having SCD itself, both appear to contribute to longer wait times for these patients. These data confirm patient anecdotal reports and are in need of intervention.},

The majority of respondents (88\%) wait until the pain intensity is an average of 8.7 (± 1.2) on a scale of 1 to 10 before seeking care. Prominent themes influencing care seeking for pain include: trying to treat pain at home, avoiding the emergency department because of past treatment experiences, the desire to avoid admission to the hospital, and the importance of time in the lives of the young adults with SCD. Young adults with SCD need additional support from family and healthcare providers in order to make timely, appropriate decisions regarding care seeking.},

The stigmatization may begin in childhood, but it is often most evident as young adults transition from pediatric care to adult care. Moreover, the stigmatization may hinder care seeking for the acute pain exacerbations of pain—the hallmark of the disease. Health-related stigma can have detrimental effects on the lives of individuals and families living with SCD. It has been supported that improving provider communication improves the health care encounter—in particular, trust—in individuals with SCD.79 However, there have been no published studies examining the impact of improving the communication skills of the individual with SCD. One way of improving communication is presenting for care before pain impacts communication. It is important to design interventions that improve communication skills and, thus, care seeking in individuals with SCD as a means to eliminate or reduce health-related stigma.},

In particular, they challenge a prevailing belief within the culture of medicine that while it may be possible to teach information about ethics (e.g., skills in recognizing the presence of common ethical problems, skills in ethical reasoning, or improved understanding of the language and concepts of ethics), course material or even an entire curriculum can in no way decisively influence a student's personality or ensure ethical conduct. To this end, several issues are explored, including whether medical ethics is best framed as a body of knowledge and skills or as part of one's professional identity. The authors argue that most of the critical determinants of physician identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a more subtle, less officially recognized “hidden curriculum.” The overall process of medical education is presented as a form of moral training of which formal instruction in ethics constitutes only one small piece. Finally, the authors maintain that any attempt to develop a comprehensive ethics curriculum must acknowledge the broader cultural milieu within which that curriculum must function. In conclusion, they offer recommendations on how an ethics curriculum might be more fruitfully structured to become a seamless part of the training process.},

Bias is, nonetheless, ubiquitous, making it crucial to understand its nature and linguistic realization and hence detect bias automatically. To this end we analyze real instances of human edits designed to remove bias from Wikipedia articles. The analysis uncovers two classes of bias: framing bias, such as praising or perspective-speciﬁc words, which we link to the literature on subjectivity; and epistemological bias, related to whether propositions that are presupposed or entailed in the text are uncontroversially accepted as true. We identify common linguistic cues for these classes, including factive verbs, implicatives, hedges, and subjective intensiﬁers. These insights help us develop features for a model to solve a new prediction task of practical importance: given a biased sentence, identify the bias-inducing word. Our linguistically-informed model performs almost as well as humans tested on the same task.},

	abstract = {This essay draws on qualitative social science to propose a critical intellectual infrastructure for data science of social phenomena. Qualitative sensibilities—interpretivism, abductive reasoning, and reflexivity in particular—could address methodological problems that have emerged in data science and help extend the frontiers of social knowledge. First, an interpretivist lens—which is concerned with the construction of meaning in a given context—can enable the deeper insights that are requisite to understanding high-level behavioral patterns from digital trace data. Without such contextual insights, researchers often misinterpret what they find in large-scale analysis. Second, abductive reasoning—which is the process of using observations to generate a new explanation, grounded in prior assumptions about the world—is common in data science, but its application often is not systematized. Incorporating norms and practices from qualitative traditions for executing, describing, and evaluating the application of abduction would allow for greater transparency and accountability. Finally, data scientists would benefit from increased reflexivity—which is the process of evaluating how researchers’ own assumptions, experiences, and relationships influence their research. Studies demonstrate such aspects of a researcher’s experience that typically are unmentioned in quantitative traditions can influence research findings. Qualitative researchers have long faced these same concerns, and their training in how to deconstruct and document personal and intellectual starting points could prove instructive for data scientists. We believe these and other qualitative sensibilities have tremendous potential to facilitate the production of data science research that is more meaningful, reliable, and ethical.},

As language models are increasingly applied to medicine, there is a growing interest in building algorithmic fairness into processes impacting patient care. Much of the work addressing this question has focused on biases encoded in language models -- statistical estimates of the relationships between concepts derived from distant reading of corpora. Building on this work, we investigate how word choices made by healthcare practitioners and language models interact with regards to bias. We identify and remove gendered language from two clinical-note datasets and describe a new debiasing procedure using BERT-based gender classifiers. We show minimal degradation in health condition classification tasks for low- to medium-levels of bias removal via data augmentation. Finally, we compare the bias semantically encoded in the language models with the bias empirically observed in health records. This work outlines an interpretable approach for using data augmentation to identify and reduce the potential for bias in natural language processing pipelines.},

We pretrain deep embedding models (BERT) on medical notes from the MIMIC-III hospital dataset, and quantify potential disparities using two approaches. First, we identify dangerous latent relationships that are captured by the contextual word embeddings using a fill-in-the-blank method with text from real clinical notes and a log probability bias score quantification. Second, we evaluate performance gaps across different definitions of fairness on over 50 downstream clinical prediction tasks that include detection of acute and chronic conditions. We find that classifiers trained from BERT representations exhibit statistically significant differences in performance, often favoring the majority group with regards to gender, language, ethnicity, and insurance status. Finally, we explore shortcomings of using adversarial debiasing to obfuscate subgroup information in contextual word embeddings, and recommend best practices for such deep embedding models in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Background
Clinician bias contributes to healthcare disparities, and the language used to describe a patient may reflect that bias. Although medical records are an integral method of communicating about patients, no studies have evaluated patient records as a means of transmitting bias from one clinician to another.

Objective
To assess whether stigmatizing language written in a patient medical record is associated with a subsequent physician-in-training’s attitudes towards the patient and clinical decision-making.

Design
Randomized vignette study of two chart notes employing stigmatizing versus neutral language to describe the same hypothetical patient, a 28-year-old man with sickle cell disease.

Participants
A total of 413 physicians-in-training: medical students and residents in internal and emergency medicine programs at an urban academic medical center (54\% response rate).

Main Measures
Attitudes towards the hypothetical patient using the previously validated Positive Attitudes towards Sickle Cell Patients Scale (range 7–35) and pain management decisions (residents only) using two multiple-choice questions (composite range 2–7 representing intensity of pain treatment).

Key Results
Exposure to the stigmatizing language note was associated with more negative attitudes towards the patient (20.6 stigmatizing vs. 25.6 neutral, p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, reading the stigmatizing language note was associated with less aggressive management of the patient’s pain (5.56 stigmatizing vs. 6.22 neutral, p = 0.003).

Conclusions
Stigmatizing language used in medical records to describe patients can influence subsequent physicians-in-training in terms of their attitudes towards the patient and their medication prescribing behavior. This is an important and overlooked pathway by which bias can be propagated from one clinician to another. Attention to the language used in medical records may help to promote patient-centered care and to reduce healthcare disparities for stigmatized populations.},

	abstract = {Negative attitudes toward patients can adversely impact health care quality and contribute to health disparities. Stigmatizing language written in a patient’s medical record can perpetuate negative attitudes and influence decision-making of clinicians subsequently caring for that patient.To identify and describe physician language in patient health records that may reflect, or engender in others, negative and positive attitudes toward the patient.This qualitative study analyzed randomly selected encounter notes from electronic medical records in the ambulatory internal medicine setting at an urban academic medical center. The 600 encounter notes were written by 138 physicians in 2017. Data were analyzed in 2019.Common linguistic characteristics reflecting an overall positive or negative attitude toward the patient.A total of 138 clinicians wrote encounter notes about 507 patients. Of these patients, 350 (69\%) were identified as female, 406 (80\%) were identified as Black/African American, and 76 (15\%) were identified as White.  Of 600 encounter notes included in this study, there were 5 major themes representing negative language and 6 themes representing positive language. The majority of negative language was not explicit and generally fell into one or more of the following categories: (1) questioning patient credibility, (2) expressing disapproval of patient reasoning or self-care, (3) stereotyping by race or social class, (4) portraying the patient as difficult, and (5) emphasizing physician authority over the patient. Positive language was more often more explicit and included (1) direct compliments, (2) expressions of approval, (3) self-disclosure of the physician’s own positive feelings toward the patient, (4) minimization of blame, (5) personalization, and (6) highlighting patient authority for their own decisions.This qualitative study found that physicians express negative and positive attitudes toward patients when documenting in the medical record. Although often not explicit, this language could potentially transmit bias and affect the quality of care that patients subsequently receive. These findings suggest that increased physician awareness when writing and reading medical records is needed to prevent the perpetuation of negative bias in medical care.},

	abstract = {Objective:
The majority of cancer patients suffer from severe pain at the advanced stage of their illness. In most cases, cancer pain is underestimated by clinical staff and is not properly managed until it reaches a critical stage. Therefore, detecting and addressing cancer pain early can potentially improve the quality of life of cancer patients. The objective of this research project was to develop a generalizable Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to find and classify physician-reported pain in the radiation oncology consultation notes of cancer patients with bone metastases.
Materials and Methods:
The texts of 1249 publicly-available hospital discharge notes in the i2b2 database were used as a training and validation set. The MetaMap and NegEx algorithms were implemented for medical terms extraction. Sets of NLP rules were developed to score pain terms in each note. By averaging pain scores, each note was assigned to one of the three verbally-declared pain (VDP) labels, including no pain, pain, and no mention of pain. Without further training, the generalizability of our pipeline in scoring individual pain terms was tested independently using 30 hospital discharge notes from the MIMIC-III database and 30 consultation notes of cancer patients with bone metastasis from our institution’s radiation oncology electronic health record. Finally, 150 notes from our institution were used to assess the pipeline’s performance at assigning VDP.
Results:
Our NLP pipeline successfully detected and quantified pain in the i2b2 summary notes with 93\% overall precision and 92\% overall recall. Testing on the MIMIC-III database achieved precision and recall of 91\% and 86\% respectively. The pipeline successfully detected pain with 89\% precision and 82\% recall on our institutional radiation oncology corpus. Finally, our pipeline assigned a VDP to each note in our institutional corpus with 84\% and 82\% precision and recall, respectively.
Conclusion:
Our NLP pipeline enables the detection and classification of physician-reported pain in our radiation oncology corpus. This portable and ready-to-use pipeline can be used to automatically extract and classify physician-reported pain from clinical notes where the pain is not otherwise documented through structured data entry.},

In this work, we find that racial disparities which have been reported in existing literature are also present in the MIMIC-III database. We hypothesize that one underlying cause of this disparity is due to mistrust between patient and caregivers, and we develop multiple possible trust metric proxies (using coded interpersonal variables and clinical notes) to measure this phenomenon more directly. These metrics show even stronger disparities in end-of-life care than race does, and they also tend to demonstrate statistically significant higher levels of mistrust for black patients than white ones. Finally, we demonstrate that these metrics improve performance on three clinical tasks: in-hospital mortality, discharge against medical advice (AMA) and modified care status (e.g., DNR, DNI, etc.).},

	abstract = {There is strong consensus regarding the need for multi-level interventions (MLIs) to address today's complex health problems. Several longstanding social ecological frameworks are commonly referred to in guiding MLI development. The specificity and comprehensiveness of these frameworks unwittingly suggest that the totality of included influences are important in all health contexts. Not surprisingly, when viewed as requiring intervention at all levels of influence, MLIs are often considered to be infeasible due to sizeable cost and logistical barriers. Thus, efforts to develop and evaluate MLIs have been extremely limited, and comparatively few examples are found in the health literature. We argue that operational frameworks to identify which levels matter in which contexts – henceforth, referred to as parsimony – could accelerate the field towards broader use of MLIs. We suggest a hypothetical operational framework informed by complexity theory and pragmatic approaches that could enable us to conceptualize, design and evaluate MLIs to consider where reflexive and recursive process mechanisms that cross levels should be targeted by MLI. The approach also emphasizes sustainability of MLIs. Without developing parsimony-based operational frameworks to move us forward, we fear that little will change, and we will simply continue to talk, without proceeding to the walk.},

	abstract = {Pain is a significant public health problem, affecting millions of people in the USA. Evidence has highlighted that patients with chronic pain often suffer from deficits in pain care quality (PCQ) including pain assessment, treatment, and reassessment. Currently, there is no intelligent and reliable approach to identify PCQ indicators inelectronic health records (EHR). Hereby, we used unstructured text narratives in the EHR to derive pain assessment in clinical notes for patients with chronic pain. Our dataset includes patients with documented pain intensity rating ratings {\textgreater} = 4 and initial musculoskeletal diagnoses (MSD) captured by (ICD-9-CM codes) in fiscal year 2011 and a minimal 1 year of follow-up (follow-up period is 3-yr maximum); with complete data on key demographic variables. A total of 92 patients with 1058 notes was used. First, we manually annotated qualifiers and descriptors of pain assessment using the annotation schema that we previously developed. Second, we developed a reliable classifier for indicators of pain assessment in clinical note. Based on our annotation schema, we found variations in documenting the subclasses of pain assessment. In positive notes, providers mostly documented assessment of pain site (67\%) and intensity of pain (57\%), followed by persistence (32\%). In only 27\% of positive notes, did providers document a presumed etiology for the pain complaint or diagnosis. Documentation of patients’ reports of factors that aggravate pain was only present in 11\% of positive notes. Random forest classifier achieved the best performance labeling clinical notes with pain assessment information, compared to other classifiers; 94, 95, 94, and 94\% was observed in terms of accuracy, PPV, F1-score, and AUC, respectively. Despite the wide spectrum of research that utilizes machine learning in many clinical applications, none explored using these methods for pain assessment research. In addition, previous studies using large datasets to detect and analyze characteristics of patients with various types of pain have relied exclusively on billing and coded data as the main source of information. This study, in contrast, harnessed unstructured narrative text data from the EHR to detect pain assessment clinical notes. We developed a Random forest classifier to identify clinical notes with pain assessment information. Compared to other classifiers, ours achieved the best results in most of the reported metrics.},

A promising avenue is the secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs), where patient data are analyzed to conduct clinical and translational research. Methods based on machine learning to process EHRs are resulting in improved understanding of patient clinical trajectories and chronic disease risk prediction, creating a unique opportunity to derive previously unknown clinical insights. However, a wealth of clinical histories remains locked behind clinical narratives in free-form text. Consequently, unlocking the full potential of EHR data is contingent on the development of natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically transform clinical text into structured clinical data that can guide clinical decisions and potentially delay or prevent disease onset. Objective: The goal of the research was to provide a comprehensive overview of the development and uptake of NLP methods applied to free-text clinical notes related to chronic diseases, including the investigation of challenges faced by NLP methodologies in understanding clinical narratives. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and searches were conducted in 5 databases using “clinical notes,” “natural language processing,” and “chronic disease” and their variations as keywords to maximize coverage of the articles. Results: Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes. Conclusions: Efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora.},

This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes. Conclusions: Efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora.},

	abstract = {Objective:
The majority of cancer patients suffer from severe pain at the advanced stage of their illness. In most cases, cancer pain is underestimated by clinical staff and is not properly managed until it reaches a critical stage. Therefore, detecting and addressing cancer pain early can potentially improve the quality of life of cancer patients. The objective of this research project was to develop a generalizable Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to find and classify physician-reported pain in the radiation oncology consultation notes of cancer patients with bone metastases.
Materials and Methods:
The texts of 1249 publicly-available hospital discharge notes in the i2b2 database were used as a training and validation set. The MetaMap and NegEx algorithms were implemented for medical terms extraction. Sets of NLP rules were developed to score pain terms in each note. By averaging pain scores, each note was assigned to one of the three verbally-declared pain (VDP) labels, including no pain, pain, and no mention of pain. Without further training, the generalizability of our pipeline in scoring individual pain terms was tested independently using 30 hospital discharge notes from the MIMIC-III database and 30 consultation notes of cancer patients with bone metastasis from our institution’s radiation oncology electronic health record. Finally, 150 notes from our institution were used to assess the pipeline’s performance at assigning VDP.
Results:
Our NLP pipeline successfully detected and quantified pain in the i2b2 summary notes with 93\% overall precision and 92\% overall recall. Testing on the MIMIC-III database achieved precision and recall of 91\% and 86\% respectively. The pipeline successfully detected pain with 89\% precision and 82\% recall on our institutional radiation oncology corpus. Finally, our pipeline assigned a VDP to each note in our institutional corpus with 84\% and 82\% precision and recall, respectively.
Conclusion:
Our NLP pipeline enables the detection and classification of physician-reported pain in our radiation oncology corpus. This portable and ready-to-use pipeline can be used to automatically extract and classify physician-reported pain from clinical notes where the pain is not otherwise documented through structured data entry.},

	abstract = {Sickle cell disease affects more than 100,000 individuals in the United States, among whom disease severity varies considerably. One factor that influences disease severity is the sickle cell disease genotype. For this reason, clinical prevention and treatment guidelines tend to differentiate between genotypes. However, previous research suggests caution when using a claimsbased determination of sickle cell disease genotype in healthcare quality studies., The objective of this study was to describe the extent of miscoding for the major sickle cell disease genotypes in hospital discharge data. Individuals with sickle cell disease were identified through newborn screening results or hemoglobinopathy specialty care centers, along with their sickle cell disease genotypes. These genotypes were compared to the diagnosis codes listed in hospital discharge data to assess the accuracy of the hospital codes in determining sickle cell disease genotype. Eighty-three percent (sickle cell anemia), 23\% (Hemoglobin SC), and 31\% (Hemoglobin Sβ+ thalassemia) of hospitalizations contained a diagnosis code that correctly reflected the individual's true sickle cell disease genotype. The accuracy of the sickle cell disease genotype coding was indeterminate in 11\% (sickle cell anemia), 12\% (Hemoglobin SC), and 7\% (Hemoglobin Sβ+ thalassemia) and incorrect in 3\% (sickle cell anemia), 61\% (Hemoglobin SC), and 52\% (Hemoglobin Sβ+ thalassemia) of the hospitalizations. The use of ICD-9-CM codes from hospital discharge data for determining specific sickle cell disease genotypes is problematic. Research based solely on these or other types of administrative data could lead to incorrect understanding of the disease.},

There is uneven availability and utilization of multidisciplinary specialty clinics for different genetic diseases. For 2 disorders (ie, hemophilia and cystic fibrosis), effective national networks of specialty clinics exist and reach large proportions of the target populations. For other disorders, notably, sickle cell disease, fewer such centers are available, centers are less likely to be networked, and centers are used less widely. Models of comanagement are essential for promoting ongoing communication and coordination between primary care and subspecialty services, particularly during the transition from pediatric care to adult care. Evaluation of the effectiveness of different models in improving outcomes for individuals with genetic diseases is essential.},
